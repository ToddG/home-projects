###### panels

Main panel has a 125A breaker on the incoming line, followed by a 125A breaker on the feeder to the subpanel, and a 'spare' 20A breaker.

The subpanel, which powers the entire house has the following two columns:

|Amps|Amps| 
|----|----|
|40|40|

#### stage 1: research and plan

* research high efficiency hvac/water heaters
* get quotes from hvac companies to replace both
* price out components
* decide on replacement components
* decide on company to do the work
* determine all external dependencies
    * Seattle City Light AM/PM
    * Lead time to order parts/components

[ ] Have detailed plan, timeline, etc.

#### stage 2: stop using chimney

* replace hvac systems

[ ] Chimney is not being used


#### stage 3: job site

* make the chimney safe to work around, either
    * request a power disconnect (called an AM/PM, costs $1K)
    * hire an electrician to move the service
* buy, borrow, or rent trailer
* buy, borrow, or rent scaffolding
* buy, borrow, or rent tools (air hammer, etc.)
* erect scaffolding (attach to side of house)
* buy & deploy safety lines, harness, hardhat

[ ] Job site is prepped and safe

* decom
    * tear down the chimney
    * patch the siding
    * patch the roof

##### Seattle City Light: 206-684-3000

Just talked to my Seattle City Light rep. Got great info:

* no crews currently operating for next 2 days, not sure when they will start back up
* governor has a stop work order in effect through the end of April
* need to consult an electrician as i'll be adding draw to my service (adding two heat pumps, doh!, and may add charging for an electric car eventually)
* current service is probably up to 200Amps, judging from the size of the wires going into the WeatherHead
* need to check the rating on the panel size *and* the meter base
* fee for an AM/PM drop/connect is $1K
* Rep suggested I consult an electrician and they could route the service to a better location farther from the chimney, and upgrade the house wiring, add the circuits for the heat pumps, etc.

[ ] check rating on panel size
[ ] check rating on meter base

BTW - If you look at the service photos, the electrical tape is fraying off where it enters the WeatherHead
